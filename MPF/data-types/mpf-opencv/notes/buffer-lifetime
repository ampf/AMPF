mpfcomponent:

In _chain, buffers come in with one reference inherited by the element.
For management purposes (collecting data of the same timestamp), another reference 
will be added as the buffer comes in.
This reference will be removed after the processing cycle completes as all the 
buffers for the current timestamp are removed from their queues.


user component:

When getting a piece of data, a reference is being inherited by the component.  The 
component is responsible for requesting that it be made writable if necessary.  Once 
the component is done with a piece of data, it must dispose of it one of two ways: 
a) push it out to the next component, or free it.
