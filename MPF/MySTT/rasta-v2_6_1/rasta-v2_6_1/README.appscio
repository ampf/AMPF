This is a mildly modified version of the standard ICSI rasta
release. The only changes are to modernize slightly for more recent
versions of gcc. Installation should be as simple as ./configure,
make, make install.

There is also a file called rasta_mpf_test.c. This is NOT the mpf
component! It's used for debugging the interface, but just reads and
writes to stdin/stdout. The mpf component is bundled separately.
