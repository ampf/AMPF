 *	A pointer to the fvec structure (float vector plus length) holding
 *	this computed array is returned to the calling program.
 *
 *      This routine is friendly to being called with different 
 *      frame lengths at different times (because ....?). 
 *      It checks the size of the currently-held output fvec, 
 *      and reallocates it if the required size changes. (dpwe 1997sep09)
