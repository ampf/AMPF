GETTING STARTED
===============

To build your component:

./autogen.sh
make

If mpf-core and other packages you depend on are not installed on the system, you must add them to pkg-config's search path:

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:.../mpf-core:.../data-types/mpf-iplimage

To use the component that just built, you must either add the appropriate location to GStreamer's search path:

export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=$GST_PLUGIN_PATH:.../components/mycomponent/.libs

or install your component on the system:

sudo make install

To see your component:

gst-inspect | grep mycomponent


ADDING LIBRARIES
================

To add particular libraries that your component may require, you have to modify the configure.ac file.  At this point the library must be supplied with a pkg-config file (.pc) in order to be used, later versions of the configure.ac file will include examples for bare libraries.

Look at the section that brings in the mpf-core package:

dnl ---------- External library dependency ----------
PKG_CHECK_MODULES(MPF_CORE, mpf-core,
  ,  AC_MSG_ERROR(no MPF Core libraries found (mpf-core)))

dnl make _CFLAGS and _LIBS available
CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $MPF_CORE_CFLAGS"
LIBS="$LIBS $MPF_CORE_LIBS"
dnl ---------- External library dependency ----------

Simply copy that entire section for each of your external dependencies, and change all instances of 'mpf-core' to the name of that package.


ADDING ADDITIONAL SOURCE FILES
==============================

To add another source file to the project, simply put it in place and add it to the list of sources for the component in Makefile.am:

libmycomponent_la_SOURCES = mycomponent.c othersource.c
