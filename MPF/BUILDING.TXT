Pre-requisites for MPF Build
----------------------------

Fedora 10
---------
1. Install the Redhat Fusion repository (current URLs as of 12/2008)

      sudo rpm -Uvh http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm

2. Bring all of GStreamer up-to-date

      yum install gstreamer*

3. Make sure you have lots of packages (92 isn't enough)

	  gst-inspect
	  ... blah blah blah
	  Total count: 197 plugins, 894 features

4. Turn off SE Linux Management (change Enforced mode to Permissive in System and Current Enforcing modes)
   to suppress relocation errors for libgstproc

      SELinux is preventing gst-inspect-0.1 from loading /usr/lib/sse2/libpostproc.so.51.2.0 which requires text relocation.

      System | Administration | SE Linux Management

5. Install Ant, and optional packages:

      sudo yum install ant ant-trax

6. Build GRDF:

      pushd ../GRDF
      ant
      popd

7. Build and test MPF (all tests should pass).

	  ant
	  ant test-build

8. Examine the test results:

	  ant html-report
	  firefox junit_results/html/index.html

   A couple of tests are currently failing intermittently with the following error:

      junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: test components.mpf-pipeline.tests.test-7 process returned 134
	  stderr:
	      mpf_component_send_outbuffers: component=appscio-mpf-identity0 pad=output result=wrong-state != ok

   These can be safely ignored (they appear to be a race-condition on shutdown).

9. You should have the distribution below this directory (MPF).  Remember to '. setup.sh' to set your paths
   before using the locally built component.
