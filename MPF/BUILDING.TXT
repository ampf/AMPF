Pre-requisites for MPF Build
----------------------------

Fedora 10
---------
1. Install the Redhat Fusion repository (current URLs as of 12/2008)

      sudo rpm -Uvh http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm

2. Bring all of GStreamer up-to-date

      yum install gstreamer*

3. Make sure you have lots of packages (92 isn't enough)

	  gst-inspect
	  ... blah blah blah
	  Total count: 197 plugins, 894 features

4. Turn off SE Linux Management (change Enforced mode to Permissive in System and Current Enforcing modes)
   to suppress relocation errors for libgstproc

      SELinux is preventing gst-inspect-0.1 from loading /usr/lib/sse2/libpostproc.so.51.2.0 which requires text relocation.

      System | Administration | SE Linux Management


5. Add the Appscio repository to yum:

	  sudo wget http://www.appscio.com/repository/packages/continuous/trunk/fedora/10/RPMS/appscio.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/appscio.repo

6. Install the mpf core

      sudo yum install mpf*

7. Build MPF components:

      ./build-components.sh

   or build everything using Ant:

      ant

8. You should have the distribution below `pwd`.  Make sure to source 'setup.sh' to fixup paths:

      . setup.sh
