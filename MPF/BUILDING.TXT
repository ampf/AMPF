Pre-requisites for MPF Build
----------------------------

Fedora 10, 11, 12
-----------------

1. Install the Redhat Fusion repository (current URLs as of 12/2008)

      sudo rpm -Uvh http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm

2. Bring all of GStreamer up-to-date

      sudo yum install gstreamer*

3. Make sure you have all the expected GStreamer plugins and features

      gst-inspect
	  ... 
	  Total count: 197 plugins, 894 features

4. Install remaining package dependencies for MPF

      sudo yum install check opencv

   (NOTE: MPF does not currently work with OpenCV version 2, which is installed with Fedora 13.  Version 1.1 is required). 

5. Turn off SE Linux Management (change Enforced mode to Permissive in System and Current Enforcing modes)
   to suppress relocation errors for libgstproc

      SELinux is preventing gst-inspect-0.1 from loading /usr/lib/sse2/libpostproc.so.51.2.0 which requires text relocation.

6. Install Ant, and optional packages:

      sudo yum install ant ant-junit ant-trax

7. Build GRDF:

      pushd ../GRDF
      ant
      popd

8. Build and test MPF (all tests should pass). This uses autotools, and generates a *lot* of console outputs, most
   of which can be ignored.

	  ant
	  ant test-build

9. Examine the test results:

	  ant html-report
	  firefox junit_results/html/index.html

   A couple of tests are currently failing intermittently with the following error:

      junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: test components.mpf-pipeline.tests.test-7 process returned 134
	  stderr:
	      mpf_component_send_outbuffers: component=appscio-mpf-identity0 pad=output result=wrong-state != ok

   These can be safely ignored for now (they appear to be a race-condition on shutdown).

10. You should have the distribution below this directory (MPF).  Remember to '. setup.sh' to set your paths
   before using the locally built component.


11. [Optional] Install GRDF and MPF on your system, in the 'standard' (/usr) locations:

     pushd ../GRDF; ./build-components.sh --install; popd
     ./build-components.sh --install

    You may have to 'export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib' to make the libraries visible to gst-launch etc.

12. [Optional] Uninstall GRDF and MPF from your system:

     pushd ../GRDF; ./build-components.sh --uninstall; popd
     ./build-components.sh --uninstall

     This is advisable if you are doing development to avoid problems caused by installed components 'hiding'
     uninstalled (development) components.

     If you chose to do development on a machine with installed components, make sure that the GST_PLUGIN_PATH
     established by setup.sh has local .libs directories *ahead* of /usr/local/lib.
