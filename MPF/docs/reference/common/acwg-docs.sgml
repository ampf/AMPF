<para>Introduction</para>
<para>Welcome to the Appscio Media Processing Framework (MPF) guide to component writing. This guide will help you understand what MPF is and how to apply the technology. The goal of this document is to provide an introduction to MPF (Chapter 1), help you build your first component package (Chapter 2), understand how to convert an existing component for custom needs (Chapter 3), learn how to expand your MPF component by adding parameters and meta data (Chapter 4, Chapter 5), develop your own ontology (Chapter 6) and finally understand how to create a new data type library for many components to share (Chapter 7).</para>
<para>It is hoped that this document will also serve as guide to best practices for component writing, and provide you a way to quickly develop your own components to meet your needs.</para>
<para>To best understand this technology you will need to have some understanding of C/C++ programming, Make, XML, Subversion, Yum, RPM, and Linux. Most Open Source software developers and researchers will already have familiarity with these tools, and people interested in this technology will probably have little trouble learning the tools listed. It is recommended you dive in, and see where extra reading may be needed. A reference section has been included at the end of this document to help with getting details on technology related to MPF development and use. Following the reference is a Glossary to help in learning the terms.</para>

<para>What is Appscio(TM) MPF?</para>
<para>The Appscio Media Processing Framework (MPF) is an open software framework that is independent of media formats and data types. To promote adoption it is distributed as open source software. To leverage existing work it is implemented as an extension to one of the most mature and respected open source projects (GStreamer) and employs the W3C standard for expressing metadata, RDF.</para>
<para>At its heart the Appscio MPF is a tool for configuring and executing "pipelines" composed of multiple media algorithms. A Pipeline is a sequence of Algorithms (wrapped with Appscio MPF code) configured to perform an application-specific Service. Services implemented in Pipelines can be as simple as transcoding a media file from one format to another or as complex as generating a transcript from the audio track, recognizing people in the video stream or both.</para>
<para>Algorithms perform a wide variety of elementary functions and fall into distinct categories. CODECs compress (encode) and decompress (decode) audio and video (AV) signals. Filters modify frames in AV signals. Detectors identify objects (words, faces, text, etc.) and behaviors (e.g. motion) in AV channels. Classifiers and Recognizers associate structured fragments of metadata with objects and behaviors. Analytics distill, improve, combine and/or summarize fragments of metadata.</para>
<para>The Appscio MPF provides a mechanism for communicating semantic metadata between Algorithms. Metadata is "published" and consumed through Pads implemented in Appscio MPF software Wrappers around elementary media algorithms. Algorithms are assembled in a Pipeline and metadata flows "downstream" through Pads forming a "metadata channel."</para>

<para>How to Use MPF</para>
<para>The most common use for MPF will be to build solutions for to integrate media with META DATA. This framework allows the developer to simply mix XML META DATA with video, audio and even video/audio streams/images to allow for a many ways to control and alter media for a special need. The framework provides a common and standard system to allow for communications with many other systems. Most media systems today are considered stove pipes, and this framework allow for creative flow beyond the core system. The potential integrations are incredible and take us from science fiction to the now. The following are some scenarios how MPF can help, and as time progresses, more and more component sets and data types will become available to make the integrations with your desired platform easier.</para>
<para>Scenario 1 - Security Camera Integration</para>
<para>Consider the simple security camera. You only care about when something happens. For instance, you are monitoring a closed door and empty room after hours. More than likely, there is no pressing need to save all of the data showing the closed door, however, it is important to not only monitor when the door is opened. Why not record just a frame every 10 seconds when the door is closed, and really take some significant actions when that door opens. </para>
<para>The potential solution would be to integrate your security video feed and hook it into your MPF interface. You would want to work with components to first record an image about every 10 seconds per your requirement, next you would integrate the XML META DATA to send off messages to monitoring devices and to record time and other parameters of interest. The data contained in the XML META DATA may be hooked to other software systems to provide alerts to security staff, and turn on more recording, lock down systems and detection devices until the threat has been understood.</para>
<para>Scenario 2 - Personalized Marketing</para>
<para>Now, here is something for some potential controversy. Let's say you are the CTO of a large chain of department stores, and your leaders call for a more personalized experience for shoppers. Maybe you think for a moment about some of the science fiction movies where face recognition systems can identify who you are and map it to database of personal information. Yes, you can do it, you realize you just need to connect the face recognition system to your security camera video feeds, and then use MPF to help you map faces to a the database of registered preferred shoppers. The face will be recognized from your database and matched to user preferences, interests and possibly needs. The information can be quickly passed to an available sales clerk who can quickly connect with the customer and direct them of items of interest. As you can imagine, there are many options that could be adapted to this scenario.</para>
<para>Scenario 3 - C4I with a Robot on Mars</para>
<para>You are tasked to enhance the communications with your robotic explorer on Mars. The problem is you have control the burst of data received when telecommunications have been re-established with the robot after a period of outage. Of course the goal is to do as much data transfer as possible before communications are lost again. </para>
<para>The solution, integrate MPF component sets with your C4I systems. This will allow the XML META DATA layer to be added to filter data, issue commands, control the image and audio data. </para>
<para>Scenario 4 - Video Conferencing</para>
<para>As some may be aware, many of the video conferencing systems in existence have a difficult time sharing data and communications between competing systems. Therefore, it is the hope that MPF will be able to cross the boundaries and provide a standard that will allow for cross platform communications and data exchange. The idea of the Appscio Media Processing Framework is to provide a common interface of communications that is open. Just as XML is an open standard, it is the goal of MPF that the shared components will provide an open standard infrastructure.</para>
<para>How to Customize MPF</para>

<para>&lt;---------------- Data Library --------------------&gt;</para>
<para>Think of situation where your web cam has some face recognition. The taxonomy would be a type face:nose:eye, and the face consists of nose and eye data types. The Presentation would execute the component sets with the Taxonomy. The component sets would consist of extractFaces, toFaceImage. The data library will have many Data types which will consist of image types, audio types, formats and other types yet to be created. For this example data types may be faceImageType, toFaceImage. It is expected external applications to MPF will create the Presentation and the Taxonomy. Whereas in MPF you will find Data Types and Component Sets. The Data Types and Component Sets will be found in MPF, and are expected to be reusable with many combinations that will make it easy to build complex systems. </para>
<para>In summary, MPF is about Data Types, Component Sets and Pipelines. Chapter 2 will help you get started with the Component package, and Chapter 7 will get into the details of building your own data types.</para>
<para>How to Contribute to MPF</para>
<para>First, join the Appscio Media Processing Framework Open Source Community at <ulink url="http://www.appscio.org/">http://www.appscio.org</ulink>. Within this community you will find the information to get involved. </para>
<para>Second, contact the management of the Appscio MPF community to become a recognized contributor to the projects. Appscio will provide many incentives for contributing. </para>
<para>Finally, follow the current best practices and Appscio MPF contribution processes, and you will be on your way to being significant contributor. The processes and procedures for contribution will be an ongoing change. Therefore, the process is documented here at high level, and with the hope you are directed to the path of your desire.</para>

<para>Expanding the Capabilities of your Component</para>
<para>Adding Libraries to your Component</para>
<para>ADDING LIBRARIES================</para>
<para>To add particular libraries that your component may require, you have to modify the configure.ac file. At this point the library must be supplied with a pkg-config file (.pc) in order to be used, later versions of the configure.ac file will include examples for bare libraries.</para>
<para>There's a section in place initially that brings in the mpf-core package:</para>
<para>dnl ---------- External library dependency ----------PKG_CHECK_MODULES(MPF_CORE, mpf-core,, AC_MSG_ERROR(no MPF Core libraries found (mpf-core)))</para>
<para>dnl make _CFLAGS and _LIBS availableCFLAGS="$CFLAGS $MPF_CORE_CFLAGS"LIBS="$LIBS $MPF_CORE_LIBS"dnl ---------- External library dependency ----------</para>
<para>Simply copy that entire section for each of your external dependencies, and change all instances of 'mpf-core' to the name of that package.</para>
<para>Adding Source to your Component</para>
<para>ADDING ADDITIONAL SOURCE FILES==============================</para>
<para>To add another source file to the project, simply put it in place and add it to the list of sources for the component in Makefile.am:</para>
<para>libmycomponent_la_SOURCES = mycomponent.c othersource.c</para>
<para>Questions:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>If I want to use the iplimage library in my component, what changesdo I need to make to my Makefile.am?I tried adding:libmpf_cvoptflowbm_la_LIBADD = libmpf-iplimage.laIs that correct?I think I also need something so it will find the include files.What should I add for that?ANSWER For new packages external to the existing mpf-iplimage package, youwould refer to it in the same way mpf-core is. That is, you'll have toadd a section similar to the mpf-core block in configure.ac, and add theappropriate MPF_CORE_CFLAGS et al to Makefile.am. The mpf-autotemplatepackage is a good starting point actually. </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If my component takes 2 images as input, should I have 2 imput pads(seems easier) or 1 input pad which needs to read in 2 images (seemsmore complicated)?ANSWER Always separate pads, unless those two images are used for e.g. arunning temporal average, in which case you have to hang on to areference to the previous frame etc. </para>

<para>TEST RESULTS/HARNESS:</para>
<para>The C/C++ test harness is executable from both the command line and from inside Eclipse IDE. However, the test harness is still in a very early state.</para>
<para>Command-line based transcoding-tests (as part of smoke tests) have been conducted and documented on the Appscio wiki. However, Flash support required the gst-plugins-bad and gst-plugins-ugly packages;these work in part (more below) on Fedora 9 but are not yetrebuilt/tested on CentOS 5.1</para>
<para>GStreamer transcoding with FFMPEG/Flash related plugins have hadvarious bugs that require work arounds. For example, the followingwork-around (requiring insertion of audioconvert) for FLV to OGG:</para>

<para>be clear in intro (Chap 1) there are 2 things we do (2 roles)Here is where we talk how to write a data librarydata libraries - includes and/or supports Components</para>
<para>[... mtg notes: Wayne suggests this is a distinct subject, apart from Component Writing]</para>
<para>Create the Data Library from the Template</para>
<para>Follow the instructions in Chapter 2 for "Steps for New Component". However, instead of executing the "newcomponent" script, execute the "new-data-type" script.</para>
<para>Distinction of Data Types</para>
<para>The following needs to be rewritten However, it does have some useful information for the distinction of data types, and can be used as a starter.</para>
<para>I cruising along until the latest repository structure was set up forpublic MPF.</para>
<para>components-&gt; mpf-cvoptflowbm</para>
<para>data-types-&gt; mpf-opencv-&gt; mpf-pocketsphinx</para>
<para>From what I was understanding before was that mpf-cvoptflowbm,mpf-opencv and mpf-pocketsphinx were all considered components.</para>
<para>All 3 contain components, but opencv and pocketsphinx both currentlyalso contain data types. A future project is to split both of thoseinto 2 packages each, would be mpf-iplimage + mpf-opencv (and probablympf-opencv-...) and mpf-rdf-stt + mpf-pocketsphinx. The first of eachpair would stay in data types, the second would move to components.</para>
<para>Therefore, my question is what makes mpf-cvoptflowbm a component?As a package it only contains components.</para>
<para>My other question is where I can find some documentation of what a datatype is for MPF. Is this GStreamer terminology?</para>
<para>This is a fundamental aspect of what makes MPF superior for these kindsof pipelines, the data types provide a layer on top of GStreamer padsthat presents the developer only with the types they want to deal with(e.g. IplImage*) and lets the component template code deal with theGstBuffers that are associated with them. Each data type lib has a setof functions to manage those associated buffers, as far as buffer size,reference counting, etc.</para>
<para>Third question, why is grdf located in "other". What is the "other"directory for?grdf is not related to GStreamer at all, it is a foundation library uponwhich the mpf-rdf type and its subtypes are being built.</para>
